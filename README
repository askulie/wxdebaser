>> INSTALLATION

Before installing wxdebaser, you'll need the debaser.py program and all of
its dependencies.  You'll find debaser.py and its install information here:
https://github.com/askulie/debaser

This particular version of Wxdebaser was built against debaser v0.54, and
thus supports all of the command line options introduced in v0.53-0.54.
If you use an older version of debaser.py, here is what to expect:
-----------------------
v0.53 - does not support the --nsfw flag.  It will still work, but if you 
check the "Allow nsfw" box, a usage error will appear in the console box.
All nsfw-tagged submissions will be automatically downloaded.
------------------------
v0.52 - does not support the --overwrite or --nsfw flags.  It will still
work, but if you check either "Overwrite" or "Allow NSFW," a usage error
will appear in the console box.  All nsfw-tagged submissions will be
downloaded, and files will be automatically overwritten.
-------------------------
Older - same behavior as v0.52, minus the usual bugfixing wizardry.

It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to use at least debaser.py v0.54 with this
version of wxdebaser.py.  This has just been documented here to show you
where the incompatibilities and issues may lie.  Wxdebaser will warn
you if you are using an older version of debaser.py when you run it.

You'll also need wxPython, which provides all the wonderful GUI fun.  You
may already have it installed depending on your distribution.  In any case,
check it out here:
http://www.wxpython.org/

Installing wxdebaser is simple...just place wxdebaser.py and d_icon.ico
in the same directory as debaser.py.
===============================================================================
>> WHAT IT DOES AND HOW TO DO IT

Debaser can scour a given subreddit for picture entries, then attempts to
download them based on various criteria.  It cannot scour images from linked
pages unless they are at imgur.com (and it also doesn't support imgur albums...
yet).

Please read the notes above about the effects of different versions of
debaser.py on the behavior of the GUI frontend.  For best, results, please
use debaser.py v0.54 or later with this version of wxdebaser.py.

Wxdebaser allows you to pass all of the parameters you would normally pass
on the command line to debaser.py but in a fancy GUI package.  It also
lets you select the directory to download to interactively.

To start Wxdebaser, type the following in your command line (or you
can create a launcher or shortcut to do the same):

python wxpython.py

You'll see a window with several fields for you to fill out.

* Destination *
This is the location where you want the image files to be downloaded to.
It can be any path you have write access to.  If you don't have write access,
you will get an exception thrown out (which you may not see if you don't run
the program from the command line).  If you click the "..." button, you
can choose the directory you want interactively through your desktop
environment's directory chooser.

Once again, please note that any files that debaser.py finds with the same
names as those in your chosen directory will be OVERWRITTEN, so be cautious.

* Subreddit *
The subreddit can be basically any subreddit that exists.  For example:  pics,
gaming, battlestations

* Filter *
The filter must be one of the following:  hot, top, controversial, or new.

* Limit *
The limit is the limit of submissions to gather from your subreddit.  Keep in
mind that the more submissions you attempt to harvest, the longer it will take
for debaser to process it, which can be a very long time at higher ranges
depending on traffic at Reddit.

Note that the widget used for the Limit field will max out at 255.  If you
need more than this, well...you'll have to use debaser.py instead.
Additionally, Wxdebaser will warn you if you have selected an absurdly high
number of submissions to download and allow you to cancel if you'd like.

* Console Window *
The large text area below these fields will show the output of debaser.py
much like invoking it from a command line would do using the --verbose flag.
This can help you quickly view all the information that's being spit out
by debaser.py.

* Overwrite *
Select this option to overwrite files in the given directory if matches
are found.  Use with caution!

* Allow nsfw*
Select this option to allow submissions tagged as "not safe for work"
to be downloaded.

* Log Output *
If you select this option, a file called ".debaser-log" will be placed
in your destination directory.  This file will include a timestamp and
all of the output shown in the console window.  If you're using the same
directory repeatedly and select the Log Output option, the file ".debaser-log"
file will be appended with a new timestamp and additional console info.

Logging output is good because (currently) it gives you a permalink to the
original Reddit submission, so you can go and read the comments (my
personal favorite part) at your liesure.

* Go! Button *
Once you've got everything set, click the Go! button to begin the process.
The GUI will hang while the downloads are happening, so wait for it to be
done before trying to do anything else.  Once debaser.py has completed its
magic, you can insert new information and start another download.

* Quitting Wxdebaser *
You can quit Wxdebaser by pressing the close button presented by your
window manager, or you can press Ctrl+Q.

Hopefully that gets you started using Wxdebaser.  Please read the README
documentation for debaser.py as well, since that will give you additional
information on what exactly Wxdebaser is doing.

Keep in mind there may be issues downloading some images.  For example,
.gifs and .pngs from imgur.com that don't use a direct "i.imgur.com" link
will probably not download properly in the current version.  Additionally,
there is a bug that seems to corrupt the download of images from wikipedia
links...they download but the file may not open (at least in gThumb and GIMP).

My hope is that this program can be used to enjoy Reddit even more!
